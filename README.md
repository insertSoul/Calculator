# Calculator
An online calculator app

Aims:
    To use all knowledge learnt to make a fully functioning (non-scientific) calculator app in the browser
    It should be able to do multiple sums by using the answer of the last calculation
    It should work both by clicking on buttons and typing in numbers on a keyboard
    Users should be able to type in floats (to 1decimal place)
    There should be a backspace button for the user inputs
    As a stretch goal i would like to be able to switch between multiple differnt UI's with the press of a button
